# Structure-Repository-Template
This will help yall make yall own repository's to help move commands and structure's easier.

Go to my Youtube to learn more @Uyuee on youtube. 

 - But the first thing you want to do is download the template file

 - once you download the template open Template/structures inside the structures is where you put the .mcstructure's at

 - to be able to make a .mcstructure file you will have to export an structure block onto an file which will be a mcstructure file
 
 -If you want to learn on how to make and create structure files go onto my youtube it would be more useful

 -once you make your structure file just put it into the Template/structures file and then move your Structure Repository file in the com.mojang/behavior_packs this will move the pack into minecraft.

I recommend Watching my videos I will show the full thing on how they work!!!!!
